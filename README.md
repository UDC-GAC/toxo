# Toxo

Toxo is an object-oriented MATLAB library for calculating penetrance tables of any bivariate epistasis model. It is solely dedicated to bivariate models, that is, models where the penetrance is an expression of two intervening variables. The user specifies the model, its desired heritability (or prevalence) and Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) and the library maximizes the resulting table's prevalence (or heritability).

Toxo does not generate population samples, and is intended to be used together with other already existing simulation software such as [GAMETES](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gametes/). In order to acomplish that, Toxo includes multiple output formats to provide compatibility with external simulators, and can be easily extended to support additional programs.

Toxo includes, as examples, two MATLAB scripts:

1. [calculate_tables.m](http): calculates the penetrance tables of the additive, multiplicative and threshold third and fourth order models, for a number of MAF and heritability combinations.

2. [usage_example.m](http): calculates a penetrance table of the 2-way additive model using MAF = 0.25 and hÂ² = 0.2, saves the table using GAMETES format, and calls GAMETES with the previous table to generate population samples.

### Using Toxo

Using Toxo starts with defining a model in CSV-like format. Not all models are supported by Toxo, make sure the desired model complies with the two requirements expressed below. Model variable values are then calculated, and the resulting penetrance table is written into a text file.

#### Model requirements

In order for Toxo to calculate the values of the two variables for which the prevalence (or heritability) is maximum, two requirements must be met:

1) Penetrance expressions are non-decreasing monotonic polynomials in the real positive number space. Polynomials that meet this criteria have positive partial derivatives for all real positive values of both variables. For example, the polynomial ![x(1+y)^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%281+y%29%5E2) is monotonically non-decreasing because ![d/dx(x(1+y)^2) = (1+y)^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x%7D%5Cbig%28x%281&plus;y%29%5E2%5Cbig%29%20%3D%20%281&plus;y%29%5E2) and ![d/dy(x(1+y)^2) = x(2y+2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctfrac%7B%5Cpartial%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20y%7D%5Cbig%28x%281&plus;y%29%5E2%5Cbig%29%20%3D%20x%282y%20&plus;%202%29) are positive for x > 0 and y > 0.
2) Polynomials can be sorted unequivocally in the real positive number space. This can be demonstrated analytically for all models by comparing the polynomials in pairs. Example:
   
   ![x(1+y)^4 >= x(1+y)^3](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%281&plus;y%29%5E4%20%26%5Cge%20x%281&plus;y%29%5E3)
   
   ![1+y >= 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1&plus;y%20%26%5Cge%201)
   
   ![y >= 0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%20%26%5Cge%200)

#### Model description

Models read by Toxo are formatted in CSV-like style, where each row represents a genotype combination and its associated penetrance (separated by a comma). The order in which the rows appear does not matter. Empty lines or lines starting with '#' (comments) are ignored.

Genotypes are represented as two characters, each one corresponding to each of the alleles from genotype. Alleles of the same genotype use the same alphabetic letter, and the difference in capitalization encodes the minor (lowercase) and major (uppercase) allele. There is no limit on the genotype combination size.

Penetrance expressions are functions of two variables. Variables can take any alphabetic name, but for simplicity we will name them x and y.

An example of model would be:

```matlab
# 2-way additive model
AABB, x
AABb, x
AAbb, x
AaBB, x
AaBb, x*(1+y)
Aabb, x*(1+y)
aaBB, x
aaBb, x*(1+y)
aabb, x*(1+y)   
```

#### Penetrance table calculation

Once the model is defined, obtaining the penetrance table is very straightforward. First the model is imported into MATLAB using the Model class. Then, the penetrance class is obtained. The last step is to save the calculated table into a file. The following code snippet exemplifies the process:

```matlab
model = 'sample_model.csv';
output = 'penetrance_table.csv';
mafs = [0.25, 0.25];
heritability = 0.1;
m = toxo.Model(model);
p = m.find_max_prevalence(mafs, heritability);
p.write(output, toxo.PTable.format_csv);
```

## 4. Classes documentation

Toxo implements two main classes, Model_ and PTable_, which encapsulate all the functionality:

Model

Model is a symbolic representation of an epistasis model. It is responsible for reading the model, parsing the text file and converting the penetrance strings to symbolic expressions. It offers two methods to calculate penetrance tables which maximize the associated penetrance or heritability under certain constraints.
